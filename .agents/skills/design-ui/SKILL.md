# Design & UI Premium Skill

Atratus must look and feel like a premium financial tool. This skill ensures visual excellence and consistency.

## 🎨 Color Palette
- **Primary (Gold)**: `#EAB308` (Yellow 500) or metallic variants. Use for call-to-actions and branding highlights.
- **Background**: `#0F172A` (Slate 900) or deeper blacks.
- **Accents**: Dark metallic blues and slate gradients for depth.

## ✨ Visual Standards
1. **Glassmorphism**: Use `backdrop-blur-lg` and semi-transparent backgrounds for headers and cards.
2. **Typography**: Use **Inter** or **Outfit** for modern professional readability. Headlines should be bold and authoritative.
3. **Micro-animations**: Implement subtle hover scales and smooth transitions (`duration-300`).
4. **Data Visualization**:
   - Use **Recharts** for all financial data.
   - Charts must use consistent gold and blue tones.
   - Ensure grid lines are subtle (`stroke="#334155"`).

## 📐 Layout Rules
- **Header**: Sticky with glassmorphism.
- **Cards**: Soft rounded corners (`rounded-xl` or `rounded-2xl`).
- **Spacing**: Generous use of white space (or dark space) to prevent information clutter.
